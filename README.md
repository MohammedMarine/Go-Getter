# Go-Getter
## What is this?
This is a end-of-studies project developped in a team of 5 students. We used the Agile/Scrum methodology where I was Product Owner/ Frontend Developer. We had a month to complete the project through 4 Sprints (1/week).

## The Project
Go-Getter is a charity providing basic necessities to people in need. As the number of these people increases, Go-Getter needed a solution to facilitate its organization from the demand to the pickup. This is what we developed.

## Main Stack
- Frontend: React/ Tailwind/ Daisy UI
- Backend: PostgreSQL/ Sequelize/

## My work on this project
- Making sure the team is aligned with the client need.
- Updating the client at each stage of the project to get validation
- All the architecture of the front
- Components: Register, Status, Message, Field, Header, MyCart, ProtectedRoute, Utils.
- Supporting the team on their tasks (front and back)
- Deployment
